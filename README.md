# Termino-logistic

## About

Termino-logistic is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Python that allows users to send HTTP requests effortlessly. It is designed to streamline API interactions by supporting request configurations via YAML and JSON files. With Termino-logistic, users can execute various HTTP methods, manage request headers, send query parameters, and handle responses with ease. This tool is ideal for developers and testers who frequently interact with APIs and require a lightweight yet flexible solution.

## How to use

Use the terminal first follow the steps and the `setup.py` file to build this project. Then run the tool by running `termino --help` in the terminal.

```sh
# example with using a yml file
termino -f request.yml
# example with using a json file
termino -f request.json

# use the -c flag for colored response
# example with using a yml file
termino -f -c request.yml
# example with using a json file
termino -f -c request.json
```

### Input Output Redirection

```sh
# the response is written to stdout, and headers/status are written to stderr,
# so that users can take IO redirection to their advantage.
termino -f myrequest.yml > res.json 2> res_headers.txt

# both stdout and stderr can be redirected to the same file
termino -f myrequest.yml > res.txt 2>&1
```

### Sample request file `myrequest.yml`

```yml
# GET Request
url: https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/api.xml?anime=4658
method: GET
params:
  offset: 2
  limit: 100
headers:
  accept: text/xml
  accept-language: en
timeout: 5000
```

```yml
# Download a book
url: http://do1.dr-chuck.com/pythonlearn/EN_us/pythonlearn.pdf
method: GET
```

**By running the command** `termino -f myrequest.yml > book.pdf`.

### A full example file `myrequest.yml`

```yml
method: XXX # (REQUIRED) GET, OPTIONS, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE
url: XXX # (REQUIRED) must be prefixed with http:// or https://

    "hobbies": ["catching pokemons", "eating", "travelling"]
  }

headers: # have as many as you like

# EITHER verify server's TLS certificate. true or false
verify: true
# OR path to a CA bundle to use
verify: some/folder/cacert.crt

# EITHER path to single ssl client cert file (*.pem)

# OR (*.cert), (*.key) pair.
cert:
  - some/folder/client.cert
  - some/folder/client.key
```

## How to Set Up the Project

### Clone the Repository in Your Local Environment

Star and Fork the repository before cloning it into your local machine. Make sure you have Python `v3.12` installed with pip, also check that Git is installed.

```sh
# do replace the <username> with your actual username
git clone https://github.com/<username>/termino-logistic.git
```

### Setting Up the Environment

For this step, you can use a Conda environment or a Python virtual environment.

```sh
# For Conda
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda env list
conda activate termino-logistic
```

```sh
# For Python Environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_Some extra Conda commands which can be helpful:_

```sh
conda env update --file environment.yml --prune
conda env export --name termino-logistic > environment.yml
conda env remove --name termino-logistic
```

_Use `pip freeze` to check if the dependencies are properly installed:_

```py
# list of libraries
certifi==2025.1.31
charset-normalizer==3.4.1
docutils==0.21.2

wheel==0.45.1
```

### Building and Uploading the Package

To build the package, use the following commands:

```sh
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload dist/*
```

#### Explanation:

- `python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` creates a source distribution (`sdist`) and a built distribution (`bdist_wheel`).
- `twine upload dist/*` uploads the generated package files to PyPI for distribution.

#### Understanding `setup.py`

The `setup.py` file defines how the package is structured and how it should be installed. Here is the key breakdown:

```py
import pathlib
from setuptools import setup

# The directory containing this file
HERE = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent
README = (HERE / "README.md").read_text()

with (HERE / "requirements.txt").open() as f:
    requirements = f.read().splitlines()

setup(
    name="termino",
    version="0.0.0",
    description="cli tool using python to send request to a server",
    long_description=README,
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    url="https://github.com/debarshee2004/termino-logistic",
    license="Apache",
    entry_points={
        "console_scripts": [
            "termino = app.main:main",
        ],
    },
    python_requires=">=3.12",
    classifiers=[
        "License :: Apache License",
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    ],
    packages=["termino"],
    include_package_data=True,
    install_requires=requirements,
)
```

- It reads dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Defines metadata like package name, version, description, license, and URL.
- Specifies the entry point (`termino = app.main:main`), allowing the tool to be run as a CLI command.
- Ensures compatibility with Python 3.12 and later.
